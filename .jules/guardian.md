## Learnings
- **D&D 5e Combat Logic**: Resistance reduces damage by half (floored). Vulnerability doubles damage. Resistance and Vulnerability stack; if both apply to one instance, calculate resistance first (floored), then apply vulnerability.
- **Testing Supabase**: Mocking the Supabase client requires careful attention to the chainable methods (`from`, `select`, `update`, `eq`, `single`). Each method in the chain should be mocked to return the appropriate next link (usually `this` or a Promise).
- **Vitest Configuration**: In this project, `vitest.config.ts` uses an explicit `include` list. New tests must be added manually to this list and to `coverage.include` for proper tracking.
- **Linting**: Strict import ordering and file length limits (200 lines) are enforced. Use `eslint-disable` sparingly for test files with complex mock setups.
- **Combat Validation**: The `CombatSequenceValidator` ensures D&D 5e rule compliance. Testing it requires covering various DM message patterns and state transitions (e.g., initiative -> turn order -> attack -> damage).
- **Test Discovery**: In this project, new tests MUST be manually added to `vitest.config.ts`'s `include` array and `coverage.include` to be picked up by the CI and coverage reporter.

## 2025-05-15 - [Character Calculations Bug Fixes]
**Learning:** Found that `calculateHitPoints` was missing the D&D 5e "minimum 1 HP per level" rule, and `calculateArmorClass` was ignoring shields and Monk shield restrictions.
**Action:** Always test D&D math utilities with extreme edge cases (like score 1, modifier -5) and negative class-specific interactions (like Monk + Shield). Centralized math utilities are prone to growing beyond 200 lines; use `eslint-disable max-lines` if refactoring isn't immediate.
