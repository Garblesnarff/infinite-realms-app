# Production deploy gate

`auto-deploy.sh` is the canonical host deploy script. Install or invoke this tracked copy from the existing deploy cron. It preserves the current single-writer behavior (`git reset --hard origin/main`, then PM2 restart) and runs the full API journey after the process binds port 8888.

The script sources `/etc/infiniterealms/llm-smoke.env`, requires authenticated checks, and never rolls back automatically. A failure names the checks and deployed SHA, sends the exact manual rollback command to `SLACK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`, and exits non-zero. Without a working webhook it also writes `/var/log/infiniterealms/DEPLOY_FAILED_SMOKE` for cron mail and operator inspection.

Supported host overrides are `INFINITE_REALMS_REPO_ROOT`, `INFINITE_REALMS_APP_DIR`, `INFINITE_REALMS_LOG_DIR`, `BUN_BIN`, `PM2_PROCESS`, and `API_SMOKE_ENV_FILE`.

## Pausing deploys

The cron fires every 15 minutes unconditionally. To hold deploys — during a
stranger-test run, or while investigating prod — create the pause file:

```bash
touch /var/lib/infiniterealms-deploy/HOLD    # hold
rm /var/lib/infiniterealms-deploy/HOLD       # resume
```

While it exists the script logs `Held: ... present` and exits 0 without
fetching, building, or restarting anything. Playtest owns this file for the
duration of a run: `touch` when posting `run N started`, `rm` at `run N ended`.

A hold older than `DEPLOY_HOLD_STALE_SECONDS` (default 10800 = 3h) raises a
rate-limited Slack alert, because a forgotten hold is indistinguishable from a
healthy quiet deploy log — that is the shape of the 2026-05-12 drift. Removing
the file clears the alert to RECOVERED.

## Rollback of the publish step

Before publishing, the live `dist/` is hardlink-snapshotted to
`/var/lib/infiniterealms-deploy/dist.prev`. If the publish rsync fails — the
one branch that leaves the server new and the docroot old-or-partial — the
snapshot is swapped back automatically, so prod stays old-client/new-API and
serving rather than 404ing hashed chunks. The snapshot is kept after a
successful deploy as the fastest manual rollback:

```bash
rsync -a --delete /var/lib/infiniterealms-deploy/dist.prev/ \
  /var/www/infiniterealms/ai-adventure-scribe-main/dist/ &&
  chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/infiniterealms/ai-adventure-scribe-main/dist
```

Additional host overrides: `DEPLOY_HOLD_FILE`, `DEPLOY_HOLD_STALE_SECONDS`,
`DEPLOY_STAGING_ROOT`.
